US	12519383	RYWZR5LFJRT2U	0439139597	667539744	Harry Potter And The Goblet Of Fire (Book 4)	Books	5	1	1	N	N	The Goblet of Fire	In reviewing the previous three Harry Potter books  I neglected to mention that Harry never really got around to liking anybody.  He was way too busy with his schooling and Quidditch to do much of anything.  Fortunately for us  this changes in The Goblet of Fire.. but I'm getting ahead of myself. <br />Starting from the beginning  Harry once again finds himself at the Dursleys... and whisked back to Hogwarts by Mr. Weasley  but not before George sabotages Dudley with his newly invented Ton-Tongue Toffee.  When Harry arrives at Hogwarts  he is shocked to hear that the Interhouse Quidditch Championship won't be held because Hogwarts  along with preppy Beauxbatons and cold  indifferent Durmstrang  will be participating in the ultimate wizarding trial: the recently-brought-back Triwizard Tournament. Each school will have one representative.  From Beauxbatons  Fleur Delacour was chosen  from Durmstrang  Viktor Krum  and from Hogwarts  Cedric Diggory... One problem: the Goblet of Fire enters another Hogwarts student into the Triwizard Tournament.  Who?  Duh.. Harry.   <br />Throughout the three trials of the Tournament  Harry learns to rely on his friends more than ever.  He also is in for the shock of his life when he and Cedric are transported to an open field  where they witness a horrible deed: Lord Voldemort (aka He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named or You-Know-Who) has risen and is back in his body.  Voldemort then kills Cedric (who is dating Cho Chang  a Ravenclaw Quidditch player and secret love of Harry [yes  he finally likes someone]) and duels Harry.  Who wins?  Duh.. Harry- but barely.  The rest is just anticlimactic and thus not worthy of mentioning here. <br />Overall rating: much better than Prisoner of Azkaban and one of Rowling's best.  100 000/100	2005-10-04

He was way too busy with his schooling and Quidditch to do much of anything.  Fortunately for us, this changes in The Goblet of Fire.. but I'm getting ahead of myself. <br />Starting from the beginning, Harry once again finds himself at the Dursleys... and whisked back to Hogwarts by Mr. Weasley, but not before George sabotages Dudley with his newly invented Ton-Tongue Toffee.  When Harry arrives at Hogwarts, he is shocked to hear that the Interhouse Quidditch Championship won't be held because Hogwarts, along with preppy Beauxbatons and cold, indifferent Durmstrang, will be participating in the ultimate wizarding trial: the recently-brought-back Triwizard Tournament. Each school will have one representative.  From Beauxbatons, Fleur Delacour was chosen; from Durmstrang, Viktor Krum; and from Hogwarts, Cedric Diggory... One problem: the Goblet of Fire enters another Hogwarts student into the Triwizard Tournament.  Who?  Duh.. Harry.   <br />Throughout the three trials of the Tournament, Harry learns to rely on his friends more than ever.  He also is in for the shock of his life when he and Cedric are transported to an open field, where they witness a horrible deed: Lord Voldemort (aka He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named or You-Know-Who) has risen and is back in his body.  Voldemort then kills Cedric (who is dating Cho Chang, a Ravenclaw Quidditch player and secret love of Harry [yes, he finally likes someone]) and duels Harry.  Who wins?  Duh.. Harry- but barely.  The rest is just anticlimactic and thus not worthy of mentioning here. <br />Overall rating: much better than Prisoner of Azkaban and one of Rowling's best.  100,000/100	2005-10-04

He was way too busy with his schooling and Quidditch to do much of anything.  Fortunately for us, this changes in The Goblet of Fire.. but I'm getting ahead of myself. <br />Starting from the beginning, Harry once again finds himself at the Dursleys... and whisked back to Hogwarts by Mr. Weasley, but not before George sabotages Dudley with his newly invented Ton-Tongue Toffee.  When Harry arrives at Hogwarts, he is shocked to hear that the Interhouse Quidditch Championship won't be held because Hogwarts, along with preppy Beauxbatons and cold, indifferent Durmstrang, will be participating in the ultimate wizarding trial: the recently-brought-back Triwizard Tournament. Each school will have one representative.  From Beauxbatons, Fleur Delacour was chosen; from Durmstrang, Viktor Krum; and from Hogwarts, Cedric Diggory... One problem: the Goblet of Fire enters another Hogwarts student into the Triwizard Tournament.  Who?  Duh.. Harry.   <br />Throughout the three trials of the Tournament, Harry learns to rely on his friends more than ever.  He also is in for the shock of his life when he and Cedric are transported to an open field, where they witness a horrible deed: Lord Voldemort (aka He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named or You-Know-Who) has risen and is back in his body.  Voldemort then kills Cedric (who is dating Cho Chang, a Ravenclaw Quidditch player and secret love of Harry [yes, he finally likes someone]) and duels Harry.  Who wins?  Duh.. Harry- but barely.  The rest is just anticlimactic and thus not worthy of mentioning here. <br />Overall rating: much better than Prisoner of Azkaban and one of Rowling's best.  100,000/100	2005-10-04

Books   5[7C1[7C1      [2;1H  N[7CN[7CThe Goblet of Fire      In reviewing the previous three Harry Potter books, I neglected to mention that Harry never really got arounn[3;1Hd to liking anybody.  He was way too busy with his schooling and Quidditch to do much of anything.  Fortunately for us, this changes in The Goblet of  [4;1HFire.. but I'm getting ahead of myself. <br />Starting from the beginning, Harry once again finds himself at the Dursleys... and whisked back to Hogwaa[5;1Hrts by Mr. Weasley, but not before George sabotages Dudley with his newly invented Ton-Tongue Toffee.  When Harry arrives at Hogwarts, he is shocked tt[6;1Ho hear that the Interhouse Quidditch Championship won't be held because Hogwarts, along with preppy Beauxbatons and cold, indifferent Durmstrang, willl[7;1H be participating in the ultimate wizarding trial: the recently-brought-back Triwizard Tournament. Each school will have one representative.  From Beaa[8;1Huxbatons, Fleur Delacour was chosen; from Durmstrang, Viktor Krum; and from Hogwarts, Cedric Diggory... One problem: the Goblet of Fire enters anotherr[9;1H Hogwarts student into the Triwizard Tournament.  Who?  Duh.. Harry.   <br />Throughout the three trials of the Tournament, Harry learns to rely on hii[10;1Hs friends more than ever.  He also is in for the shock of his life when he and Cedric are transported to an open field, where they witness a horrible  [11;1Hdeed: Lord Voldemort (aka He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named or You-Know-Who) has risen and is back in his body.  Voldemort then kills Cedric (who is dating Choo[12;1H Chang, a Ravenclaw Quidditch player and secret love of Harry [yes, he finally likes someone]) and duels Harry.  Who wins?  Duh.. Harry- but barely.   [13;1HThe rest is just anticlimactic and thus not worthy of mentioning here. <br />Overall rating: much better than Prisoner of Azkaban and one of Rowling'ss[14;1H best.  100,000/100[7C2005-10-04[1m[34m^M[m[51;1H[1m[34m@@@                                                                                                                                                   [m[52;133H[K[52;133H92,1[10C90%[15;1H[?25h[?25l[1;51r[1;1H[5L[1;52r[1;1H[1m[34m^[[m]0;eric@sjsu:/mnt/scratch/eric/ws7[1m[34m^G[m[eric@sjsu ws7]$ cat 0439139597.txt.new | head -2[1m[34m^H^[[m[K[1m[34m^H^[[m[K[1m[34m^H^[[m[K[1m[34m^H^[[m[K[1m[34m^H^[[m[K[1m[34m^H^[[m[K[1m[34m^H^[[m[K[1m[34m^H^[[m[K[1m[34m^H^[[m[K[1m[34m^H^[[m[K[1m[34m^H^^[2;1H[[m[K[1m[34m^H^[[m[K[1m[34m^H^[[m[K[1m[34m^H^[[m[K[1m[34m^H^[[m[K[1m[34m^H^[[m[K[1m[34m^H^[[m[K[1m[34m^H^[[m[K[1m[34m^H^[[m[K[1m[34m^H^[[m[K[1m[34m^H^[[m[K[1m[34m^H^[[m[K[1m[34m^H^[[m[K[1m[34m^H^[[m[K[1m[34m^H^[[m[K[1m[34m^H^[[m[K[1m[34m^H^[[m[K[1m[34m^H^[[m[K[1m[34m^H^[[m[K[1m[34m^H^[[m[K[1m[34m^H^[[m[K[1m[34m^H^[[m[K[1m[34m^G^G^G^G^G^G^G[mcat 04[1m[34m^^[3;1HG[m39139597.txt.old | head -2[1m[34m^M[m
